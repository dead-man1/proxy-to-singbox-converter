### Cloning and Running Locally

If you want to run this project locally on your device (e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows, Termux, or iSH), follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/4n0nymou3/proxy-to-singbox-converter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd proxy-to-singbox-converter
   ```

3. Start a local HTTP server:
   
   - **For Python 3.x Users:**
     ```sh
     python -m http.server 8080
     ```
   
   - **For Python 2.x Users:**
     ```sh
     python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
     ```

   - **For Termux (Android) Users:** (Ensure Python is installed using `pkg install python`)
     ```sh
     python -m http.server 8080
     ```

   - **For iSH (iOS) Users:** (Ensure Python is installed in Alpine Linux via `apk add python3`)
     ```sh
     python3 -m http.server 8080
     ```

4. Open your web browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```
   This will load the web application in your default browser, where you can use it normally.

### Stopping the Local Server

If you need to stop the local server without closing the terminal, use one of the following methods:

- Press **`Ctrl + C`** in the terminal where the server is running.
- If the terminal session is lost, find the server process with:
  ```sh
  lsof -i :8080
  ```
  Then stop it using:
  ```sh
  kill -9 PID
  ```
  (Replace `PID` with the actual process ID from the previous command.)
